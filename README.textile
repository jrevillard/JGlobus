* Release Notes *
*****************
JGlobus 2.0.5 Release Notes
- This is the first release from github and distributed through Maven central, as opposed to globus.org
- This release addresses compatibility and performance issues with the IGTF CA bundle.
- Several forward-ports of bugs reported by dCache.org.  In particular, a larger set of RDN are supported.
- CRLs are properly cached and reloaded, essential for running JGlobus as a trustmanager of a Java container.

jGlobus 2.0.4 Core Release Notes
- This release addresses internal security vulnerabilities that were identified in internal reviews in collaboration with the MyProxy team at NCSA. 
- GSS Tomcat support was moved into its own Maven project.

jGlobus 2.0.3 Core Release Notes
- caGrid changes introduced in 2.0.2 were backed-out due to incompabilities discovered between those changes and the changes GSSContextImpl.

jGlobus 2.0.2 Core Release Notes
- Password fix to GSSContextImpl.java and additional contributions from caGrid.

jGlobus 2.0.1 Core Release Notes
- jGlobus 2.0.1 Core (download) is a bug-fix release that addresses an issue with signature verification.
- This issue was discovered and addresses by Jonathan Siwek at NCSA. Details of this fix can be found at https://github.com/jglobus/JGlobus/pull/10.

jGlobus 2.0.0 All Release Notes
- jGlobus 2.0.0 (download) replaces the use of pureTLS, as was used in jGlobus 1.x, with JSSE.
  While this resulted in minor changes to the GSI API, the GRAM and GridFTP packages remain unchanged from jGlobus 1.X.
- A secondary goal was to drop or deprecated packages that are not strictly related to the use of Globus Toolkit.
  This includes, for example, the removal of the MDS package, as MDS is no longer supported in Globus Toolkit 5.X.
- jGlobus now requires Java 1.5 or higher.
