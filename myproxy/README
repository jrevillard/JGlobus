1. To build using Maven run:

mvn -DskipTests=true package

2. To build and test using Maven run:

mvn package

3. To test using Maven after building, run:

mvn test

TESTING:

The following environment variables can be used to specify the MyProxy
server and port to be used by the test suite.

       MYPROXY_SERVER
              Specifies the hostname where the  myproxy-server(8)  is  run-
              ning. Multiple hostnames can be specified in a comma separated
              list with each hostname optionally followed by a  ':'  and  port
              number. If multiple hostnames are specified, the client will
              serially try one after the other in the order specified, stopping
              with the one with which it could establish a successful network
              connection.
              The default host is "localhost" and the default port is 7512.

       MYPROXY_SERVER_PORT
              Specifies the port where the myproxy-server(8) is running.  This
              is overridden by any port number specified in the value for the
              environment variable MYPROXY_SERVER.

       MYPROXY_SERVER_DN
              Specifies  the distinguished name (DN) of the myproxy-server(8).
              All MyProxy client programs authenticate the server's  identity.
              By  default,  MyProxy  servers run with host credentials, so the
              MyProxy client programs expect the  server  to  have  a  distin-
              guished  name  with "/CN=host/<fqhn>" or "/CN=myproxy/<fqhn>" or
              "/CN=<fqhn>" (where <fqhn> is the  fully-qualified  hostname  of
              the  server).   If the server is running with some other DN, you
              can set this environment variable to tell the MyProxy clients to
              accept the alternative DN.
